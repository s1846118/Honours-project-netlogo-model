# Honours-project-netlogo-model
This repo will track the progress of the development of my ABM implemented initially in Netlogo (then potentially in C or Python). The purpose of this ABM is to model the spread on information &amp; misinformation online and analyse how different factors effect the pace and reach of the information diffusion.
